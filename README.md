## Description

When having a chat with any of the recent AI models, there are normally a couple of things missing, that would make the results of the conversation a lot more use full

### Notes

Weather you are getting ideas for your next project, planning a trip or clearing up ab obscure topic with the help of AI, you do not want to go through the whole conversation to get to it's useful information

That is why at any point in your talks with Amekhania you can ask her to save a note, albeit one that you provide, or one of her precious messages. She will also create any relevant tags for your note

After you have created so many Notes that you have no idea how to find the one you want
You can also use AI to filter through them

### Reminders

After agreeing with chatgpt on a plan, a date, a specific action that they recommend you to do, wouldn't it be great if he could create a reminder for you?

You could have chatgpt create the perfect schedule for your vacations and then save all necessary reminders, like buying the plan tickets, preparing for your trip, making restaurant reservations.....
